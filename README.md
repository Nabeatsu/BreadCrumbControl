It's a breadCrumb, control for IOS writted in swift.

The properties of "BreadCrumb" are fully accessible for the developer: color, animation etc ....
This control is provided with a sample application that lets you change the properties of the control, in real time.


# Installation in xcode project

It is a very easy control to include in your project. You just add it to your project IOS, the two files: "BreadCrumb.swift" and "CustomButton.swift". Add also the following resources: "button_start.png" and "button_start@2x.png" if you want to add a "Root" button at the beginning of BreadCrumb.

# Usage

In order to use BreadCrumb control, you can instantiate it programmatically, or create a custom view in Interface Builder and assign it to an ivar of your app. Once you have an instance, you can use the control properties to configure it.

# Compatiblity

This control is compatible IOS 8 IOS 9. It is written in swift 2.0

# Thank For

For the sample application I use the control "ColorPickerView", created by Ethan Strider on 11/28/14. This control allowed me to easily change the colors in the sample application.
